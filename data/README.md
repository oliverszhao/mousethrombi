# File Direction

The following CSV files contain volume information that is divided by platelet type (i.e. degranulated, tightly adherent, and loosely adherent), location (i.e. extravascular, intravascular, cavity; and upstream vs. downstream). These raw CSV files are used in the R code to perform basic analyses and generate the figures shown in this repository.
