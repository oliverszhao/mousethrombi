# File Direction

The following CSV files contain volume information that is divided by platelet type (i.e. degranulated, tightly adherent, and loosely adherent), location (i.e. extravascular, intravascular, cavity; and upstream vs. downstream). These raw CSV files are used in the R code to perform basic analyses and generate the figures shown in this repository.

The other CSV files contain values that were used directly in the figures, and are derived from the raw CSV files listed above. In other words, the following files are uploaded just for viewing convenience, but do not provide any information that cannot be found from the raw CSV files after some basic calculations.
